# XML-TEI Bible

This project encodes the Bible in TEI, starting with the John and Mathew Gospels, Apocalypse, Genesis, Ruth, Jonah, 75 Psalms, Acts, Malachi and Haggai in Spanish. Jos√© Calvo Tello started this project because the Bible is a interesting text that speaks to everyone, and XML-TEI makes possible to listen the text in new ways. 

And because I didn't find any XML-TEI Version of the Bible with information below the verse level like direct speech or entities.

The project has started encoding:
* Chapter, pericopes and verses
* References to peoples, places, times, groups and books, using ids
* Direct speech, including who is communicating, to whom and how (written, oral, prayer...)

This project also includes some other files:
* Scheme to control the XML-TEI
* CSS to visualize the text in Browser and correct it
* Some files of documentation
* XSLT and Python scripts to extract some interesting information
* The resulting data and visualizations
* CSV file (ontology.csv) to control the ids used
