# Documentation about the annotation of sexual themes

There is a taxonomy file with the list of the sexual themes.

# Steps
1. Anotate when the text mentions one of the themes in the taxonomy:
	a. That are marked with the type explicitly-sexual, or implicitly-sexual
	b. The values marked as no-sexual are only annotated when the in the verse there are other explicitly- or implicitly-sexual themes.
	c Men and women are marked as topics only when they play an important difference for the sexual themes. Note that men and women (both as single persons and as groups) are marked through entities.
2. When there are sexual acts, it should be also annotated:	
	a. which stage (sexual-act-stage) if specified
	b. which type (sexual-act-type) if specified
	c. which situation (sexual-act-situation) if specified
	d. which participants (sexual-act-participants) if specified
3. Whenever an explicitly sexual aspect is annotated, it should be refered with a volaration ("valorations").


# Certeinty
- Annotate the certainty of the values in the attribute @cert based on following situations:
	- high: there are clear textual evidences in the verse or in near verses
	- medium: there are some textual evidences in the verse or in near verses, although they require some interpretation
	- low: the textual evidences are weak, however either the traditions have stated this relation, or the annotator
